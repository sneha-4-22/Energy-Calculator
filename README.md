# Carbon Footprint Calculator App

## Overview

This repository contains the source code for a simple Carbon Footprint Calculator App built using Streamlit and Python. The app allows users to estimate their carbon footprint based on the energy consumption mix in their selected country.

## Development Link

The app is deployed and accessible at [https://sneha-4-22-energy-calculator-app-ngrq34.streamlit.app/](https://sneha-4-22-energy-calculator-app-ngrq34.streamlit.app/).

## Features

- Select a country from the dropdown menu.
- Adjust the percentage of energy consumption from various sources using sliders or manual input.
- Obtain the overall emission percentage and CO2 emissions in tons based on the selected energy mix.

## Usage

1. **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/sneha-4-22/Energy-Calculator.git
    ```

2. **Install the required dependencies:**
